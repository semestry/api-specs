    title: Echo Webhooks
    description: >
        This API specification describes the webhook functionality of the Echo API. Webhooks allow apps to
        receive HTTP callbacks in real-time when events happen in Echo. The [Webhook
        call](#operation/WebhookCall) POST endpoint describes the requests a receiving endpoint can expect.


        ### Creating an endpoint for webhooks


        The receiving endpoint must:


        - be accessible via an HTTPS address with a valid SSL certificate

        - be able to correctly process `event` requests

        - never send a response larger that `32KB`.


        ### Receiving data


        Echo makes a HTTP `POST` request to the configured webhook URL. All requests are sent with content
        type `application/json` and contain an `event` message with a `data` property that is specific to the
        type of event. Please refer to the [Webhook call](#operation/WebhookCall) POST endpoint for details
        on the exact contents of the request body and headers.


        *At least once* delivery is used. This means that events might be delivered multiple times, for
        example as a result of [error handling](#error-handling). Endpoints can use the `X-Echo-Delivery-Id`
        HTTP header to deduplicate events.


        Echo supports Basic Authentication and Bearer tokens via the `Authorization` HTTP header. It is up to
        the receiving endpoint to validate the credentials.


        ### Responding to a webhook


        Receiving endpoints must return a HTTP status code `2xx` to acknowledge it received the request. You
        should return an empty body with your response.


        Any other HTTP status codes indicates that you did not receive the webhook and are considered an
        error response. This includes HTTP `3xx` redirection codes, these are not followed by Echo. Endpoints
        must never send a response larger that `32KB`.


        Receiving endpoints must respond to Echo within 10 seconds. If no response is received within 10
        seconds, this is considered an error response.


        It is best practice to acknowledge webhook requests immediately, and defer processing of the request
        (i.e. making additional network calls, performing complex logic, et cetera).


        ### Error handling


        If a request to the receiving endpoints fails, Echo starts a retry process. As a result of this,
        events might be delivered multiple times (for example when an endpoint _did_ receive a message, but
        _did not_ respond within 10 seconds). Endpoints can use the `X-Echo-Delivery-Id` HTTP header to
        deduplicate events.


        Echo might drop events if a certain delivery queue size threshold is exceeded due to retries. The
        oldest events is dropped first. When endpoints are down for an extended period of time, they
        might be automatically disabled.


        Endpoints are responsible for discarding events that are not relevant anymore. For example, events
        that are bound to a certain time (e.g. a scheduled activity from a timetable) that has already passed
        should not be forwarded to end-users.

        # Authentication

        Receiving endpoints can implement two types of authentication:

          - Basic HTTP Authentication
          - Authentication using Bearer tokens

        # Localization

        Echo is currently unaware of the user's preferred locale. So when one wants to localize messages
        presented to the user, let's say render notifications in an app, this localization needs to happen in
        the app.

        For this reason, API responses can include human-readable strings in multiple locales.

        These are organised in the following `LocalizedString` object structure as documented below.

        The API user can then select the representation in the desired locale.

        It should check whether a locale-specific representation is available and fall back to the default
        representation if unavailable.


        This also means this datatype can be used in notification payloads when posting notifications to Echo.
        Currently, when Echo renders notifications (for example, when sending email notifications) it uses
        the representation for the default locale.

        ### LocalizedString

        String with representations in multiple locales.

        <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/LocalizedString" />

        # Events

        Events are used to communicate when something interesting happens in Echo. For example, when a batch
        of notifications is created, an `Event` with the type `notification_batch.created` is created.

        ## Event types

        These are the event types that currently exist:


        | type                         | description                                                 |

        |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

        | `notification_batch.created` | Event indicating one or more changes to a user's timetable. |

        | `ping`                       | _Currently unused._                                         |


        We may add more event types at any time, so in developing and maintaining your code, you should not
        assume that only these types exist.

        # Well-known Notification Types

        Notification types are dynamic, so it would be impossible to list them here.

        The contract is that sender and receiver should agree on the schema of the payload.

        To facilitate this, we have defined some well-known notification types.


        ## timetable_change


        This type of notification indicates a change within the user's timetable.


        One notification is sent per changed timetable event in a specific timetable, so when multiple events
        change, multiple notifications are sent.

        Also, when an event belongs to multiple timetables, multiple notifications are sent.

        These notifications may or may not be grouped together in a batch.
