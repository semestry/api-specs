    title: Echo Webhooks
    description: >
        This API specification describes the webhook functionality of the Echo API. Webhooks allow apps to
        receive HTTP callbacks in real-time when events happen in Echo. The [Webhook
        call](#operation/WebhookCall) POST endpoint describes the requests a receiving endpoint can expect.


        ### Creating an endpoint for webhooks


        The receiving endpoint must:


        - be accessible via an HTTPS address with a valid SSL certificate

        - be able to correctly process `event` requests

        - never send a response larger that `32KB`.


        ### Receiving data


        Echo will make a HTTP `POST` request to the configured webhook URL. All requests will be sent with
        content type `application/json` and will contain an `event` message with a `data` property that is
        specific to the type of event. Please refer to the [Webhook call](#operation/WebhookCall) POST
        endpoint for details on the exact contents of the request body and headers.


        *At least once* delivery is used. This means that events might be delivered multiple times, for
        example as a result of [error handling](#error-handling). Endpoints can use the `X-Echo-Delivery-Id`
        HTTP header to deduplicate events.


        Echo supports Basic Authentication and Bearer tokens via the `Authorization` HTTP header. It is up to
        the receiving endpoint to validate the credentials.


        ### Responding to a webhook


        Receiving endpoints must return a HTTP status code `2xx` to acknowledge it received the request. You
        should return an empty body with your response.


        Any other HTTP status codes indicates that you did not receive the webhook and will be considered an
        error response. This includes HTTP `3xx` redirection codes, these will not be followed by Echo.
        Endpoints must never send a response larger that `32KB`.


        Receiving endpoints must respond to Echo within 10 seconds. If no response is received within 10
        seconds, this will be considered an error response.


        It is best practice to acknowledge webhook requests immediately, and defer processing of the request
        (i.e. making additional network calls, performing complex logic, et cetera).


        ### Error handling


        If a request to the receiving endpoints fails, Echo will start a retry process. As a result of this,
        events might be delivered multiple times (for example when an endpoint _did_ receive a message, but
        _did not_ respond within 10 seconds). Endpoints can use the `X-Echo-Delivery-Id` HTTP header to
        deduplicate events.


        Echo might drop events if a certain delivery queue size threshold is exceeded due to retries. The
        oldest events will be dropped first. When endpoints are down for an extended period of time, they
        might be automatically disabled.


        Endpoints are responsible for discarding events that are not relevant anymore. For example, events
        that are bound to a certain time (e.g. a scheduled activity from a timetable) that has already passed
        should not be forwarded to end-users.

        # Authentication

        Receiving endpoints can implement two types of authentication:

          - Basic HTTP Authentication
          - Authentication using Bearer tokens

        # Localization

        Echo is currently unaware of the user's preferred locale. So when one wants to localize messages
        presented to the user, let's say render notifications in an app, this localization needs to happen in
        the app.

        For this reason, API responses can include human-readable strings in multiple locales.

        These are organised in the following `LocalizedString` object structure as documented below.

        The API user can then select the representation in the desired locale.

        It should check whether a locale-specific representation is available and fall back to the default
        representation if unavailable.


        This also means this datatype can be used in notification payloads when posting notifications to Echo.
        Currently, when Echo renders notifications (for example, when sending email notifications) it uses
        the representation for the default locale.

        ### LocalizedString

        String with representations in multiple locales.

                `name` is a localized string of the event name, providing a user friendly description of the event.


                `attributes` contains all changed attributes for this event, for example the location when an
                event has been moved to another location.


                Only one of the `created`, `updated` and `removed` properties can be true.


                `oldSchedule` refers to when the old activity was scheduled, `newSchedule` to when the new activity is
                scheduled. Their behaviour is as follows:


                - When `created` is `true`, `oldSchedule` is `null`. `newSchedule` contains the date of the
                current scheduled event.

                - When `updated` is `true`, `newSchedule` contains the date of the rescheduled event.
                `oldSchedule` contains the date of the old event.

                - When `removed` is `true`, `newSchedule` is `null`. `oldSchedule` contains the date of the
                unscheduled event.


                For the `attributes` property, the behaviour is as follows:


                - When `created` is `true`, `attributes` contains all new attribute values. Since there are no
                old values, these will all be set to `null`.

                - When `updated` is `true`, `attributes` contains all changed attribute values. Attribute
                values that have not changed will not be included. Old or new values can be null when an attribute
                was added or removed.

                - When `removed` is `true`, `attributes` does not contain any values. In a future
                implementation, `attributes` might include the old values of the attributes.
