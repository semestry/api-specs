        # Introduction

        This API specification describes the functionality of the Echo REST API.


        Please refer to the [Echo Webhook API documentation](https://api-docs.mytimetable.net/echo-webhooks)
        for more information on the webhook system.


        # Authentication

        The current Echo API only supports basic authentication. Make sure to keep your authentication details
        secure. Do not share your authentication details in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub,
        client-side code, and so forth.


        All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without
        authentication will also fail.


        <security-definitions />


        # Errors

        HTTP response codes are used to indicate the success or failure of an API request. The following
        response codes can be expected:

        - 2xx codes indicate success

        - 4xx codes indicate client errors (e.g., a required parameter is missing, the requested object does
        not exist, etc.)

        - 5xx codes indicate server errors on the Echo side


        General response codes, such as `401 Unauthorized` are not documented per call. The following general
        response codes can be returned by the API:


        - 401 Unauthorized

        - 403 Forbidden

        - 405 Method Not Allowed

        - 406 Not Acceptable

        - 415 Unsupported Media Type


        If any response code have a specific meaning for a certain call, they are documented as such with the
        call.


        # Localization

        Echo is currently unaware of the user's preferred locale. So when one wants to localize messages
        presented to the user, let's say render notifications in an app, this localization needs to happen in
        the app.

        For this reason, API responses can include human-readable strings in multiple locales.

        These are organised in the following `LocalizedString` object structure as documented below.

        The API user can then select the representation in the desired locale.

        It should check whether a locale-specific representation is available and fall back to the default
        representation if unavailable.


        This also means this datatype can be used in notification payloads when posting notifications to Echo.
        Currently, when Echo renders notifications (for example, when sending email notifications) it will
        use the representation for the default locale.

        ### LocalizedString

        String with representations in multiple locales.

                                `newSchedule` will contain the schedule of the newly created event.
                                `attributes` will contain all attributes. Since there are no old attribute
                                values, these will all be `null`.

                                exclusive with `updated` and `removed`.


                                `oldSchedule` will contain the schedule of the event before the update,
                                `newSchedule` will contain the schedule of the event after the update.
                                `oldSchedule` and `newSchedule` will be equal if the schedule is not updated.
                                `attributes` will only contain changed attributes. Old or new values can be
                                `null` when an attribute was added or removed.
                            type: boolean

                                `true` if the event has been removed from the timetable. Mutually exclusive
                                with `updated` and `removed`.


                                `oldSchedule` will contain the schedule of the event before removal.
                                `attributes` will be empty. In a future implementation, `attributes` might
                                include the old values.
                            type: boolean

                                `oldSchedule` will contain the schedule of the event before removal or
                                rescheduling. `newSchedule` will contain the schedule of the event after
                                creation or rescheduling.

            Events are used to communicate when something interesting happens in Echo. For example, when a
            batch of notifications is created, an `Event` with the type `"notification_batch.created"` is
            created.


            You can use an endpoint to retrieve an [individual event](#operation/GetEvent). We also have a
            separate [webhooks system](https://api-docs.mytimetable.net/echo-webhooks) for sending the `Event`
            objects to an endpoint on your server in a push-based manner.

            ### Event types


            These are the event types currently existing:


            | type                         | description                                                 |

            |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

            | `notification_batch.created` | Event indicating one or more changes to a user's timetable. |

            | `ping`                       | _Currently unused._                                         |


            We may add more event types at any time, so in developing and maintaining your code, you should
            not assume that only these types exist.
    -   name: WellKnownNotificationTypes
        description: >-
            Notification types are dynamic, so it would be impossible to list them here.

            The contract is that sender and receiver should agree on the schema of the payload.

            To facilitate this, we have defined some well-known notification types.


            ## timetable_change

            This type of notification indicates a change within the user's timetable.


            One notification will be sent per changed timetable event in a specific timetable, so when
            multiple events change, multiple notifications will be sent.

            Also, when an event belongs to multiple timetables, multiple notifications will be sent.

            These notifications may or may not be grouped together in a batch.
